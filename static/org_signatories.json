This recent event should alarm all who participate in any shape or form of life on the Berkeley campus, including faculty, staff, campus workers, and especially students. If collective action geared towards Palestinian liberation from these groups is not taken, UC Berkeley, and the UC system at large, will continue to further its efforts in repressing free speech and ensuring that the status quo it has built through exploitation and capitulation is held."

    "additional_testimony": "Peyrin Kao stands in a long tradition of Berkeley activism dedicated to justice, human rights, and the liberation of all oppressed peoples - and his willingness to undertake a 38-day hunger strike, in solidarity with Palestinians who are being deliberately starved, shows the depth of his moral commitment.\n\nAll the more disappointing, then, that UC Berkeley has decided to suspend him on dubious premises. The University's attack on his academic freedom is not an isolated incident - it is part of a pattern of repression against free speech at universities across the country. It is a preemptive capitulation to the Trump administration, a cowardly McCarthyist attempt to suppress dissent and sideline the US-backed genocide in Gaza. History will judge harshly. \n\nWe at Stanford admire Peyrin's courage and look to him as a moral exemplar for our own work. As he has noted publicly, Big Tech is deeply complicit in Israel's genocide, and there is much work that we must do to overturn these systems of oppression. We are proud to stand in solidarity with him and wish him all the best.\nReinstate Peyrin Kao, divest from genocide, and free Palestine!"
