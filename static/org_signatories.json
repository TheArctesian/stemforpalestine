    "additional_testimony": "Peyrin Kao’s suspension is a severe escalation from the UC Berkeley administration in trying to silence any word of its complicity in the ongoing genocide in Palestine and its material support in upholding US imperialism. This recent event should alarm all who participate in any shape or form of life on the Berkeley campus, including faculty, staff, campus workers, and especially students. If collective action geared towards Palestinian liberation from these groups is not taken, UC Berkeley, and the UC system at large, will continue to further its efforts in repressing free speech and ensuring that the status quo it has built through exploitation and capitulation is held."
