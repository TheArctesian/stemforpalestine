      "comment": "A core element of Berkeley's Data Science curriculum has always been that data and computer science are inherently political. Regardless of your personal views, suspending a lecturer for reinforcing that our actions as programmers and scientists have human consequences completely subverts this message. In a hypothetical world where Peyrin spoke out in favor of Israel and got suspended, my response here would be the same. With our position at the forefront of big tech, Berkeley plays a vital role in shaping the narrative about what Data Science is. It's imperative for the future that we push it in the right direction. No matter how much easier our jobs would be if tech and data existed in a vacuum, we can't just ignore the human contexts of the technology we create or the data we gather: history has shown time and time again how this leads to strife, inequality, and disaster. The decision to suspend Peyrin--who has been nothing short of a stellar and incredibly hard-working teacher in all the classes I've taken with him--just for reminding students that their actions have consequences sends all the wrong messages in this regard."

By doing this, you are depriving students of education for no reason other than to distract us from a global genocide. This is especially true since Peyrin has taken all necessary steps to keep his opinions about Palestine separate from his lectures. It is cruel what the university is doing. As a graduate student at UC Berkeley who has been here for several years, this has changed my view of the university. My fellow graduate students agree with me, and we will no longer support the university as we enter the workforce."

He's always the first to respond to questions from students or staff, he works far past midnight to keep his courses running smoothly, and he does so for two classes that he teaches simultaneously. He continued to operate like this even during his hunger strike without any visible effect on his quality of work. Peyrin is the backbone of the undergrad CS department. This a blatant violation of free speech and a terrible loss for a department who already undervalues his work."

Yet at the end of his Investigation Letter, Mr. Hermalin still brought up the possibility of firing Peyrin on the basis of his own ridiculous subjective opinions (namely, after class time = class time; and looking fatigue due to a hunger strike = political advocacy), knowing perfectly well that such a termination would end this 26-year-old promising beloved young lecturer's teaching career, for a crime he did not commit.  The viciousness and the total disregard for UCB staff's well-being of this Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost is astonishingly appalling."

It's notable that Peyrin Kao speaking briefly outside of class hours about his principles and about human rights has led to his suspension, while rallies and speakers like those hosted by Turning Point USA, which lead to emails from campus warning queer students about their safety should they go near, are allowed to occur without any blocking from campus. The campus finds speech outside of the classroom fine if it is dangerous to queer students, but abominable if it is in support of human lives. As Foucault taught us, all speech is political - and lack of speech can be also. In STEM fields, we must be very aware of what our work leads to - the kind of speech we perform in our actions and words. (In my field, physics, the specter of the atomic bomb haunts us still.) Surely it is our duty as STEM staff and instructors to speak about what our work can lead to, and the ethical care we must have."

In no shape or form was his defense of Palestinian HUMAN rights detracting from his ability to teach or quality of his instruction. \n\nThe punishment he has received by campus administration is a dark, bloody stain on the EECS department and the entire university. I personally recommend that prospective young minds seeking a computer science education look elsewhere. Berkeley has chosen to punish a star lecturer and a star human being."

Higher education should nurture students into better human beings for the betterment of our entire society.  Peyrin Kao is demonstrating the most important lesson a student can learn: as engineers, we cannot bury our heads in the sand, telling ourselves that our only responsibility is to deliver within tolerances and on time.  We MUST take responsibility for the deeds that are done with the technologies and tools that we create.  This is especially important for engineers, as multiple sociological studies have shown that engineering students are disproportionately predisposed to authoritarian and fascist ideologies(1).  I would hope that the fact of UC Berkeley's moral duties would be a sufficient motivator, but if not, then maybe they would find shame more compelling.  The tide of public opinion has shifted.  Half of Americans believe that what is occurring in Gaza is a genocide(2). Being on the wrong side of history in this would be such a dark stain on the reputation of the institution. \n\n(1) https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349110866_Science_education_against_the_rise_of_fascist_and_authoritarian_movements_towards_the_development_of_a_pedagogy_for_democracy\n\n(2) https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/28/half-of-us-voters-believe-israel-committing-genocide-in-gaza-poll-says"

If the concern is that Peyrin's academic performance as a teacher will suffer: look at his track record. Look at all of the students who've taken his classes. Look at the testimony of how far above and beyond he goes to make sure his students succeed. It's preposterous. And secondly, and more importantly: if the worry is that not eating enough will make his teaching suffer, shouldn't the focus be on the fact that hundreds, thousands of children are also not eating enough? That they are suffering? That they are dying? Shouldn't the focus be on making sure they can eat, so Peyrin can eat?\n\nIf speaking out against injustice is in violation of the rules, then those rules must be torn to pieces. Those who uphold them and those who defend them must be thrown from their positions. It is always the case that the institutions of the status quo will support any injustice that is advantageous to the power of the status quo. Therefore there is nothing special, nothing sacred, about the laws those institutions make. They are just words on paper, and can, and in fact should, be defied when those words run contrary to justice. To do otherwise is a monstrous thing. MLK Jr. knew this. So did John Brown. Peyrin Kao is holding the torch of justice high, and now we have to choose whether to follow him."

It is an open secret that without his active presence in teaching Berkeley's CS undergrads, the department's courses will begin to strain and break under the immense load required to run them. As my friend and colleague Kenny has already mentioned, his commitment to doing everything possible to teach students even when courses are packed with hundreds of students is beyond compare. I cannot personally count the amount of times course staff has been overwhelmed or unsure of what to do and been saved by Peyrin's expertise and thorough pedagogical commitment. We know that since any solution offered by the university that stops short of his full reinstatement will be woefully inadequate for the students of Berkeley, that must be the only solution we are willing to accept."

He sacrifices so much just to have his students learn as much as they can without the payment he deserves to receives, but he doesn't care about that -- he just wants everyone to have the ability to learn. Peyrin clearly mentions to his students that they can leave whenever he talks about Palestine and there should not be punishment for free speech, especially at UC Berkeley and when it isn't affecting students' learning. Without Peyrin, UC Berkeley's computer science department will severely suffer and the university will soon see the effects. I'm proud to have taken two courses with Peyrin and am ashamed of Berkeley."

He consistently goes above and beyond in his responsibilities, a fact supported by forum statistics and extensive student feedback: this semester he is the number one Edstem responder for CS61B. From my direct experience, it is clear that he brings a wide breadth of knowledge in administering these courses and a deep consideration for his students’ learning. At no point has he attempted to politically indoctrinate either students or staff, and even during his hunger strike, the quality of instruction and staff support never slipped. This is unacceptable behavior from the university."

The threat to academic freedom anywhere is a threat everywhere. Restoring Peyrin Kao is an indispensable first step to strengthening academic freedom and to Palestinian freedom."

Super active on zoom chat when Josh was lecturing, super active on Edstem, grading done more quickly than most classes, good availability for office hours, and still the same standard for his own lectures. Josh regularly mentions how Peyrin is basically superhuman in terms of class infrastructure, and that's not just for 61b.\n\nTo say that it got in the way of his job is honestly laughable. CS is highkey cooked next semester cause that man is the key to the smooth running of multiple classes (and the department is already understaffed).\n\nand that's not even mentioning the neutrality of the advocacy he was suspended for.\n\nthe one time he has really talked about Palestine, it was a \"you can leave, this is not part of the class\" after a discussion on ethics.\n\nAnd the advocacy was literally just \"innocent people are starving and dying in Gaza, and it should stop. The US govt is using our tax dollars to essentially kill people, and that's really shitty\" in paraphrased terms.\n\n\"we shouldn't fund/support a genocide\" should not be grounds for suspension, to be honest that's just a normal and ethical view and barely political.\n\n\"Additionally, the article quotes VP Hermalin as saying that Kao was suspended for \"the visible physical toll of Kao’s hunger strike”. In other words, they suspended him because his hunger strike made him look hungry and looking hungry in class was determined to be political speech,  like \"a professor who might wear a political T-shirt.\"\" (from a comment on the initial Daily Cal reddit post).\n\nI think everyone can tell that that is absolute bullshit.\n\nThis is a school that promotes its relevance in terms of advocacy, and to suspend Peyrin over this is just pure hypocrisy.\n\nTLDR: Peyrin's suspension is stupid and unwarranted, and the CS department is highkey cooked next semester because of it."

Having worked closely with Peyrin on course staff for a handful of semesters, I can personally attest that Peyrin was the life and soul of the EECS department, working tirelessly to ensure the highest standard of education.\n\nCrucially, Peyrin handled his personal beliefs with great nuance. I never once witnessed, neither as his student nor as a TA on his course staff, Peyrin imposing his views on students or staff. Rather, he exemplified the highest standards of academic integrity. The accusation that Peyrin violated Regents' Policy appears to be a pretext for selective enforcement. If it was truly Vice Provost's Hermalin's obligation to apply this standard of compliance universally, then it strikes me that the Office of the Provost would soon run out of letterheads to sign. Again, it seems that this was, in fact, not Vice Provost's Hermalin's directive, effectively rendering his myopic application of Regents' Policy as inconsistent, discriminatory, and unjust."

He has continued to go above and beyond, personally responding to many of my questions in moments of desperation. 2. He never explicitly brought up his chosen causes during class time. 3. As a Jewish student, I have to make something clear: No matter how much you may want to paint it this way, support for ending the genocide In Gaza is not “political”. It is a straightforward matter of human rights. 4. Frankly, considering the thorn in UC’s side that is the ongoing call for divestment, this feels like petty retribution for an employee holding a critical opinion of the UC’s actions. Not a good look in terms of public opinion, especially in this day and age."

It is abysmal and horrifying to watch our university parade itself as a sanctuary for critical inquiry, innovation, free speech, and intellectual freedom while actively penalizing members of the community who actually stand by these values—it is clear to me now that the very principles UC Berkeley prides itself on are nothing more than a mere selling point to prospective students and faculty members, seeing as they cease to exist once you actually get here. I am deeply disappointed and humiliated by UC Berkeley and its EECS/CDSS departments for their willful ignorance of genocide and blatant disregard for ethical standards. Rather than continuing to reinforce the false narrative that science and tech are politically neutral studies, the #1 public university in the nation should be able to teach its students that our educational pursuits and career choices are indeed vital to the context of sociopolitical issues. Instead, they fail to do so and choose to silence those who do, like Peyrin; I can only hope to have a quarter of the courage and integrity he possesses, and that would still be more than UC Berkeley's administration will ever have."

And now, knowing of such decision, I'm disheartened and am doubtful of the strength for academic integrity the university is willing to uphold, what innovative worldmaking (such as the refusal of STEM students in compliance of warmongering system, for a more peaceful, safer world instead) is possible/endorsed/not punished at Cal. Very disheartening, because I did (and still do) have much hope for what Cal community has been creating and can create. Please reconsider. Please amend."

Shame on the university who prides itself on freedom of speech for cherry picking who gets to be heard; why should TPUSA get a platform but not one of Berkeley's own staff?

The fact that Cal was the birthplace of the Free Speech Movement is one of our best-selling points, and it's hypocritical and alarming seeing the school take such an antithetical role in silencing Peyrin. He's taught thousands of students and we need someone like him teaching. As a Cal CS Alum and former member of 61B course staff, I know how hard it is to staff these courses well and suspending Peyrin is morally reprehensible, but also detrimental to the EECS department. UC Berkeley should be protecting its faculty, staff, and students. Bending the knee to the Trump admin and making an example of some of our most vulnerable (lecturers) is unethical and a smear on our university's legacy.\n\nThe statement about Peyrin's suspension mentioned that he used the classroom for political advocacy and that is what warranted this suspension. However, Jonathan Shewchuk refused to cancel class and offer a remote option for COVID, as he actively propagated anti-vaccine conspiracy theories and also sent right wing conspiracy theorist emails to all TAs/Students telling them what to do and how to act with regards to covid (aka dismiss it completely as he believed it a hoax) fully on academic time in his capacity as a professor. Shewchuk also posted misogynistic incel content on student advice forums. He gave a minimal apology for the latter but faced no consequences when actively causing harm on university time with his dangerously misinformed political \"advocacy\". \n\nUC Berkeley is one of the best universities in the world, our computer science department is one of (if not the) best, and we pride ourselves in being on the right side of history. I have immense love for this school, and especially for the vast majority of the EECS department faculty and staff. I hope that you do the right thing by reinstating Peyrin. We need his teaching but also his voice now more than ever."

Peyrin must be reinstated now."

      "comment": "Peyrin is the best lecturer I’ve had at UC Berkeley in computer science. It has always been his very first priority to make his students feel safe, heard, and understood. Though STEM is inherently political as it shapes human rights, never once did Peyrin even allude to his political views during class time, and never once did the quality of his commitment to his teaching falter even during his hunger strike. His suspension for engaging in a hunger strike as a peaceful act of protest against the genocide of the Palestinian people is a profound betrayal of the values UC Berkeley claims to uphold. STEM is not morally neutral. Cloud services, AI systems, and weapons technology, all fields shaped by universities like ours, play a direct role in the violence Palestinians face. Peyrin is one of the few faculty members who has openly asked us to confront that reality, and his courage is exactly what academic spaces should protect, not punish. ​​As the letter states, there are no universities left in Gaza. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinian students have lost years of education, and it is unconscionable for UC Berkeley to claim it is protecting “the rights of all to teaching and learning” while disciplining a lecturer who demanded an end to the destruction of an entire people’s educational future. I am signing because divestment is the bare minimum, and reinstating Peyrin is an urgent necessity. I am signing because I want a university that stands with those who speak for justice, not one that silences them. I am signing because I want to be proud of this institution, and right now, I cannot be unless it corrects this wrong. As a student, I stand unequivocally with Peyrin and with the people of Palestine. We will not be intimidated into silence."

He is the only one who was genuine with condolences and even offered resources Incase the grief was too much to bare throughout the semester. I truly appreciate Peyrin and only have kind words to say. I cannot say the same for many of the other CS lecturers at UCB. The only thing he is guilty of is having courage and empathy. We have the freedom to protest and speech, but why is it no longer a right against a known genocide? These actions against Peyrin aren’t justified and simply wrong. He is a critical asset to the Computer Science department. Not many CS professors at CAL are meant to teach. Peyrin is the exception and should have been protected by this institution."

This situation is particularly upsetting to me because he genuinely cares about his students, staff, and the university, quite possibly more than any other lecturer or professor I know. He is the reason why so many courses on this campus are even able to run at all. His suspension, outside of being blatantly unconstitutional, is a huge detriment to the quality of education CS students will receive. \n\nUC Berkeley, when you boast your CS ranking to the general public, know that it is only good as it is because of a man whose rights you have freely and publicly violated. When you see your TAs and students struggling next semester, remember that you had the ability to put your those people as well as your constitution and morals first, and chose not to. And when you read an article citing your university as the birth of the Free Speech Movement, or when FSM cafe re-opens and you read those stories and quotes on the wall, remember that you have disgraced that legacy and every single person who fought for it.  \n\nI am beyond disappointed in you."

My own research and scholarly discipline is predicated on the idea that science, technology, and medicine, are not neutral scientific enterprises. I teach undergrads-- frequently, those in the college of engineering and the new college of CS-- that science is a social process, and that the choices they make as scientists have profound historical, cultural, and ethical dimensions. UCVP Hermalin's letter is not merely an affront to academic freedom of speech. It also serves only to marginalize scholarship that affirms with Prof. Kao shared with his class: that being a scientist does not make you immune from ethical inquiry. My own ability to teach UC Berkeley undergrads is undermined by the insistence from the highest level of the university that there is no appropriate consideration of ethics or politics that can be allowed in the STEM classroom. It makes it actively more difficult to engage with students when University messaging positions STEM as neutral, empirical, and apolitical. Why would we want to send graduates into the world who are encouraged to dodge difficult questions about the impact they want their work to have in the world?"

The AI and computing technologies being used to surveil Palestinians and mark them for death are most certainly built upon Berkeley innovations in computer vision, databases, etc. At the very least, then, now is the time for us computer scientists to recognize the evil our contributions are being used for and to stand against it. It is damning that the administration would choose to punish and silence the member of CS faculty with the greatest moral clarity around this, and I'm deeply ashamed of my alma mater. (And I'm sure when I visit campus in 30 years I'll be able to drop in on the \"Free Palestine\" Cafe, where there'll be a plaque honoring Peyrin's bravery so the administration can reap the reputational rewards of having always been against genocide once it is again politically convenient.)"

He is passionate about Palestinian lives, ethics in tech, and being an educator. Not only is he an asset to his department, but he is a great role model for how we can bring activism into our workplaces and communities. UC Berkeley would truly suffer without his presence, which is why this unjust suspension is even more harmful. Shame on the university for attempting to silence Peyrin Kao, who has brought attention to these issues in a way that did *not* interrupt class time or force students to do anything they did not wish to do.\nSomething that Peyrin also emphasizes is keeping Palestinian voices centered, so let’s not forget the main issue here - Palestine is still occupied and surveilled, crucial medical resources are still being blocked by their violent colonizers, and men, women, children, and elders are still needlessly dying. Shame on the university and its complicit leadership, divest from the corporations who are funding the occupation, and free Palestine."

Peyrin is one of the most capable instructors in the EECS/CS department, his teaching capabilities far outshine those of a vast majority of the professors currently tenured at this university. It is shameful that a university that prides itself on its history of supporting free speech is silencing the voices of its faculty and students alike."

Peyrin's contributions to CS at Berkeley are nothing short of a miracle for the department, and to be frank, losing Peyrin will be a disaster. The department needs to be made aware.\n\nNever have I ever seen someone as devoted or hardworking as Peyrin. Myself and/or my friends have directly seen him:\n\n- Sleep in Soda Hall after working long into the night\n- With the help of a few TA's, grade an exam literally overnight, by staying up past midnight\n- Answer so many students' Ed questions that he started to post them as invisible-to-students so that other TA's could copy-paste his responses and take the credit\n- Bail out overflowing office hours queues when TA's were swamped--even though he wasn't officially teaching that class that semester\n- Be actively working at 12AM on New Year's Day\n\nPeyrin has the unique ability to run multiple classes smoothly in a way that absolutely no professor or head TA ever could. In every semester I've worked with him, he has been majorly involved in running logistics for at the bare minimum, 3 or 4 different courses, often without even officially being an instructor. No task is too menial or too complex for him--he isn't afraid to go print exams at 3 in the morning, but has the knowledge and experience to write exam questions and deal with far-reaching course policies.\n\nWhile TA's and instructors certainly work hard, Peyrin is an incredible force multiplier and his loss would directly torpedo the effectiveness of, at minimum, 4 different key courses (CS 61B, CS 161, CS 188, CS 168). With less capacity to handle students in these classes, and with students less prepared and more stressed for follow-on courses, the effects will propagate throughout the entire department like a tsunami.\n\nAny insinuation that Peyrin's activism or hunger strike have negatively impacted his teaching abilities and student learning is preposterous, because he's always done so much more than has been expected of him. Even if he was 1/2 as productive as he is, he would still be as effective as a particularly hardworking teaching professor--and leagues beyond many of my professors, to be honest.\n\nI'll leave it to my peers to speak about other factors. But from a pedagogical standpoint, suspending Peyrin would be the biggest mistake the department could make."

So any apolitical justification makes 0 sense.\nHowever, a political justification forms this as a first amendment rights violation - if it wasn't impacting his ability to do his job, it wasn't affecting or hurting other people, than he should not be fired."

During his hunger strike, he never even told members of his staff that he was undertaking it, and only mentioned it briefly in class, without addressing the cause.\n\nIn choosing to suspend Peyrin, Vice Chancellor Hermalin and the university are clearly choosing to exercise personal bias in an attempt to appease the Trump Administration, in flagrant violation of university policy and the first amendment. Even the EE and CS chairs admit that it is unclear that this action constitutes a violation of any university policy (as per The Daily Cal).\n\nThis is NOT acceptable behavior from a university which champions itself as a bastion of free speech, nor is it an acceptable way to treat a lecturer who consistently goes above and beyond, both for his students and his department."

I have had the pleasure of organizing with him, and I am inspired by his humility and steadfastness. During his hunger strike, he constantly stated that this action is about the genocide in Palestine - not about him - and he rigorously promoted humanitarian aid efforts for individuals and families in Gaza. Peyrin's humanity has restored my previously lost hope that it is possible to be a person of conscience within the STEM community. This hope is key to my personal and professional identity, as I studied Astrophysics at Cal. In my recent-grad years, I worked as a Planetarium Educator at The Lawrence Hall of Science, where I integrated my politics of liberation into my teaching. The University's shameful attempt to silence Peyrin inspires me to speak louder - this suspension is evidence that our voices are working to bring truth to power."

It’s disappointing that the university can claim CDSS is an ethics-oriented cs/ds/stats college while simultaneously silencing and punishing educators who attempt to spread awareness on humanitarian crises happening right now, that students in said college are participating in as they enter the industry as interns for complicit companies. I was a Public Health student first, then decided to double major in Data Science, and it shocked me that fellow CS/DS majors told me they “don’t believe in the genocide”, “don’t believe protest works”, or are interning at Raytheon or something with no consideration to the implications of their career. Does that not alarm the university which goes on to have so many cs/ds students in important positions in the world? Peyrin is a great teacher and example. I took CS61B when he wasn’t teaching and dropped the class, took it again this semester and he helped a lot. I’m sure the university will look back in 50 years and preach the power and importance of students and staff who spoke up against genocide, reaping the benefits of a “progressive” and “free speech” university, but for now prefer to keep their hands bloody for the sake of money. I chose this university for its supposed values and I’m ashamed to be made a fool."

The same tactics that lead to dozens of workers at Google, Amazon, and Microsoft being fired are also being used here because Peyrin dared to speak out for what he believes in.\n\nIt's clear UC Berkeley is specifically coming after pro-Palestine speech. STEM studies are too often depoliticized and sanitized, but the truth is that nothing we study and none of the work we do can be free of politics. We need to be having more of the discussions that Peyrin was starting, not less."

The UC continues to prove, again and again, that they would rather stay financially and ideologically invested in the genocide of the Palestinian people—to the point of suspending a beloved lecturer who was holding the already underfunded, understaffed CS department together almost by himself—instead of making any ethical choices. Divest, Reinstate Peyrin, and Free Palestine!"

Secondly, even if he did, part of having a holistic, democratic education—a current disillusionment of our university—is being under the purview of passionate and opinionated individuals. Education is not merely the content we receive but social commentary that comes with it. Politics is irrevocably intertwined in education and educators and I would wish for nothing less. Peyrin never sought to convince his students of his own beliefs, but he inspired so many to have the courage to question what they believe in. This questioning of authority is the sole reason the university has crucified Peyrin; they are scared of a sentient student population."

His commitment to his students and their success is one that can only come from an inherent care for others. It’s perplexing to venerate that trait of his, but then punish it for extending beyond his classroom.\nPeyrin has always made it clear that his activism is not in representation of the university, but rather is a personal moral issue about which he feels obliged to speak. He’s never disrupted course proceedings nor harmed students’ educations for this end. In fact, any open discussion of current events, ethics, and tech complicity are all additions to the expanse of knowledge that we seek in academia. As a data science major, these same topics are emphasized in countless of the courses I’ve taken, and are topics that were most impactful on my curiosity and understanding of the field.\nIt’s an embarrassing disservice to our community for the university to punish one of our own for standing by the same principles they teach students everyday."

As a citizen of Berkeley, I’m ashamed at how far this city and university have fallen from Berkeley values. As a unionist, I can see a clear anti-worker pattern of repression. As a parent of a current Bruin, I find it depressing that our pride as a UC family for 5 generations has been diminished. We have had family members graduate from Berkeley, Santa Cruz, Davis, San Diego and LA this spring. We have had two Holocaust survivor family members who made new lives at Cal in STEM. One left Germany early and became the first woman to study microbiology at Cal. Another who had to escape the Nazis and whose wife lost her entire family and survived only because of the Kinderstanport, went on to become a Cal Microbiology Professor. Some of these family members even have a connection with Israel. As a Jewish American of Conscience I believe it is the duty of each of us to stand up against Israel’s crimes. The chancellor and the regents have chosen to use their power on the side of fascism and genocide. Shame!"

This is not just an act of absolutely unnecessary generosity and grace, but shows how much Peyrin cares for his students, and how much Berkeley would miss out.

It is once unfair for UCB to punish them and others for advocating against genocide and racism while touting itself as a bastion of activism and free speech. It has never been the university that creates or promotes these things. It has always been the people that fight against the university."

The administration at Cal continues to prove that it does not truly care about its staff or student body, and as an alumni I am thoroughly disappointed."

      "comment": "The administration at the University of California, Berkeley has an obligation to uphold the tenets of free speech that they so often promote. For an institution that supposedly prides itself on social activism and intellectual diversity, it is downright shameful that they have decided to employ punitive measures against the very activism they claim to support. The blatant bias in who is afforded the protection of free speech has become exceptionally clear when individuals opposing genocide and speaking up for human rights are demonized and penalized while others are praised for their “activism”. \n\nIt is not only hypocritical, but as an alumni who chose UC Berkeley for what I perceived to be a space rooted in justice and social accountability, it is an abhorrent reality to see that the idea of justice does not apply to all. That the idea of free speech, only applies when the institution deems the cause in their financial and political favor. As an alumna of the ethnic studies department, reflecting on the distortion between studying social movements in the classroom to watching the very same forms of activism being demonized before my eyes on the very same campus is like day and night. The gap between what is being said and what is being practiced by the institution has become a chasm covered in moral posturing and hypocrisy. \n\nLet us be clear of this administration’s preference of selective and performative activism. The free speech and civil rights movements, the anti-war movement, were all opposed, demonized, and criticized by the institution in their time. And yet, history has shown that the movement and individuals standing up for justice were right and indeed pivotal in the fight to enact meaningful change. Despite this, the administration continues to capitalize off of the actions of students and staff who risk their careers and educations to uphold the ideals UC Berkeley claims to hold. In the moment, they are always the first to abandon any staff or student who dare speak up for a cause the system doesn’t find lucrative, selectively punishing them for the very thing they claim to protect. It is only after the fact that they turn around and praise such brave individuals for their activism and advocacy. \n\nPerrin has joined the legacy of such courageous individuals who in the moment are  wrongfully penalized and demonized for the very activism that UC Berkeley praises, and who are then commended on their actions in the years to come. The hypocrisy is clear, and the double standards are embarrassing. This administration must cease their preferential treatment of staff and students who support genocide simply because it appeases the status quo and their donors. They have a moral obligation to practice what they preach. And that means respecting everyone, including and especially those who are advocating for a free Palestine given the repeated dismissal, discrimination, and systematic vulnerability these individuals endure. \n\nSince, thus far, it is evident that the administration prefers to defend proponents of genocide and ethnic cleansing, and vilify those who would oppose it, I would suggest they take heed to their own motto. The world is shedding light on the reality of this institution’s hypocrisy and performative activism. Public opinion is increasingly not on their side, and there will come a point when the light of knowledge and justice will shine through the cracks in their reputation and reveal the profiteering war machine within. So if the actions of courageous individuals like Perrin are the reason for the public to finally see through those cracks, I say, Let there be light. \n\nFor those of us who already have seen the institution’s true principles (money and political power for their elite stakeholders), we are increasing, and we demand the administration listen. Divest from weapons manufacturing and entities directly involved in the apartheid and genocide in Palestine, retract EVCP Benjamin Hermalin’s letter, and reinstate Perrin as a lecturer in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department."

UC Berkeley can and must do better by reinstating Peyrin Kao, and morally must divest from weapons manufacturing immediately."

But, in the end, nothing of what is actually grounded in concrete evidence is in violation of Regents Policy 2301. Peyrin's hunger strike was conducted in his own free time. Even according to the quote from Peyrin's August 27, 2025 lecture which is mentioned in the letter, Peyrin didn't even mention what specific cause the hunger strike was for. Hermalin explains that \"the visible physical toll is was PRESUMABLY taking\" and the \"adverse consequences it MAY have had\" is the reason why his actions are \"no different from those of an instructor who repeatedly wore a (political) t-shirt when teaching\". This line of logic doesn't make sense. What someone wears as clothes is external to themselves - to cite an educator's body being the means of political advocacy which causes the violation of Regents Policy 2301 is to say that educators can never participate in hunger strikes in their own free time, violating their first amendment. To punish Peyrin for things he did in his free time is to set a fascist precedent. This is not in alignment with the values of our university or our nation's constitution. UC Berkeley and UC Berkeley EECS, I urge you to reconsider."

I am embarrassed by the extent of faulty reasoning the administration is using to egregiously punish Peyrin Kao, and it is dangerous that the administration is attempting to establish this precedent of suppression by redefining what is “acceptable” free speech on shaky and unequal grounds, such that these terms can be shifted however the university wants, in a time of fascism and blatant white supremacy where history, science, and public information are being rewritten and lives are being taken away from the top down. This action by the university is also in complete disregard for its students. Engineering students have much to benefit from a lecturer like Peyrin, who prioritizes his students’ learning in every action as an instructor, as I have heard continuously throughout my time as a student and alum, and who is holding so much of the EECS department together for undergrads. Engineering students especially have much to learn from an instructor who truly cares about their students to discuss how the tools and infrastructure they build can help communities, rather than, at minimum, aid genocide. Many of UC Berkeley’s students have lost family members to this genocide and been harmed further by the administration’s disregard for their safety. I ask that the UC administration gain a backbone, correct its repression, and divest now."

They are also there to learn how to be a better human being just like Peyrin.\n\nThere is still time before the next semester starts.  Please do the right thing."

Over the past year however, it has become increasingly apparent to me that this university’s administration has no intention on upholding the values of free speech they so love to espouse. So long as you are speaking out against the relentless violence and genocide Israel has perpetrated against Palestinians, this university’s leadership will label you guilty of creating a “hostile learning environment.” It’s ironic coming from the same administration who readily turned over the personal information of several university faculty members and students to the federal government, and the same administration who is quick to deploy armed UCPD personnel on their own students for exercising their right to protest the presence of Turning Point USA on campus. If you are a far right extremist organization whose sole purpose is indoctrinating young Americans by propagandizing racist, hateful rhetoric and misinformation, then this university’s administration welcomes you! But if you question where your tuition dollars are going and call for financial divestment from corporations involved in weapons technology, you will be targeted. This university’s leadership exploits the school’s history of political organization and free speech to create the façade that it is a school like no other, always welcoming diverse perspectives and ideas that inspire critical thinking and challenge our world. However, their actions that have targeted pro Palestinian students and faculty provide a painful reminder that institutions of its kind have historically been complicit in upholding oppressive systems. It was the reminder I needed to understand that the legacy of Berkeley’s free speech movement and political organization does not belong to university leadership. It belongs to the students, the faculty, and the community members who fought and continue to organize for solidarity with oppressed people everywhere. Free Palestine 🇵🇸"

I wholeheartedly stand behind Peyrin and his statements, and believe that open dialogue is not harmful, especially at a collegiate level where students should be able to think critically about the world and share their thoughts. While the conflict is a sensitive and difficult topic to discuss, there is nothing wrong with standing up for humanity; using your voice for those being affected is honorable, not shameful or punishable. Peyrin encouraged dialogue from students, even if they disagree with his stance. The attacks on free speech under the current administration has been alarming; if anything, Berkeley should be upholding free speech from its students, faculty, and other affiliates, rather than suppressing it. With such a deep history involving protests and political activism, this feels like a disservice to Berkeley students who used their free speech for change. \n\nThrough reading online and testimonies from current students in his courses, Peyrin is an incredible instructor as well as an incredible human being, and such treatment is disappointing. Students at other campuses stand behind him and our other comrades at Berkeley, which is why he deserves to be reinstated and reimbursed for all missed pay (if applicable). A formal apology should also be issued by the university for their unfair dismissal of Peyrin. We stand by him, and stand for a free Palestine."

Only when it can sell Berkeley’s radical history as a brand does it even recognize our movements. \n\nStop this hypocrisy!  Reinstate Peyrin now!  Affirm our rights to express ourselves as people of conscience!  If you will not affirm human dignity yourself, don’t punish us for doing so!"

He cares about innocent children and humans and you punished him that looks horrible as a University and the Students of the University want him back. I want to be taught by people who have hearts and courage to fight for what’s right. Ignore the genocide until it’s your children being bombed and collecting their siblings blown up body parts. That’s the reality and you should care and not punish those who stand against it."

You are dishonoring the legacy of Berkeley through your actions. Reinstate Peyrin now."

The universities action to repress speech advocating for the survival and aide of innocent human beings by a lecturer for a subject with direct ties to the death and destruction rampantly occurring tarnishes the reputation of free speech and thought exchange. These actions directly undermine the College of Engineering’s claims to be “educating leaders” to “serve society” by suppressing discussion of the impacts of our studies and works."

From what I have heard from his students and course staff, he has gone above and beyond to ensure his students have a high quality education and has always delivered on doing right by his role as an instructor. It is insane to me that a university known for its free speech would suspend an instructor for exercising it outside of his role as an instructor, but I suppose it is a narrative consistent with the 1960s where it was the administration attempting to oppress the first amendment rights of its students. I am disappointed that after all of these years, we find ourselves in the same situation. If Berkeley wants to keep its reputation as an institution that values free speech, which is fundamentally one of its greatest boons, it must stand by these values. The UC Administration must weigh this long term detriment to its reputation and values above any short term financial gain made by bowing down to those in power who would like protestors punished."
