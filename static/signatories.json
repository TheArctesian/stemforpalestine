When the\nOctober 7th attacks occurred, as a Jewish student, Peyrin’s class was the class I felt the\nmost heard and the safest in.\n\nSince CS61B I have taken two other classes from Peyrin and he has been nothing but\nan excellent instructor. It is shameful that the university has decided to suspend him\nwhen he is one of the best instructors in the department and has kept his classroom a\nsafe and productive environment for all students."

      "comment": "It’s so important that educators in cs courses speak to the complicity of tech industries in the Palestinian genocide and violence worldwide. It’s disappointing that the university can claim CDSS is an ethics-oriented cs/ds/stats college while simultaneously silencing and punishing educators who attempt to spread awareness on humanitarian crises happening right now, that students in said college are participating in as they enter the industry as interns for complicit companies. I was a Public Health student first, then decided to double major in Data Science, and it shocked me that fellow CS/DS majors told me they “don’t believe in the genocide”, “don’t believe protest works”, or are interning at Raytheon or something with no consideration to the implications of their career. Does that not alarm the university which goes on to have so many cs/ds students in important positions in the world? Peyrin is a great teacher and example. I took CS61B when he wasn’t teaching and dropped the class, took it again this semester and he helped a lot. I’m sure the university will look back in 50 years and preach the power and importance of students and staff who spoke up against genocide, reaping the benefits of a “progressive” and “free speech” university, but for now prefer to keep their hands bloody for the sake of money. I chose this university for its supposed values and I’m ashamed to be made a fool."

Peyrin is one of the most capable instructors in the EECS/CS department, his teaching capabilities far outshine those of a vast majority of the professors currently tenured at this university.

This situation is particularly upsetting to me because he genuinely cares about his students, staff, and the university, quite possibly more than any other lecturer or professor I know. He is the reason why so many courses on this campus are even able to run at all. His suspension, outside of being blatantly unconstitutional, is a huge detriment to the quality of education CS students will receive. \n\nUC Berkeley, when you boast your CS ranking to the general public, know that it is only good as it is because of a man whose rights you have freely and publicly violated. When you see your TAs and students struggling next semester, remember that you had the ability to put your those people as well as your constitution and morals first, and chose not to. And when you read an article citing your university as the birth of the Free Speech Movement, or when FSM cafe re-opens and you read those stories and quotes on the wall, remember that you have disgraced that legacy and every single person who fought for it.  \n\nI am beyond disappointed in you."

During his hunger strike, he never even told members of his staff that he was undertaking it, and only mentioned it briefly in class, without addressing the cause.\n\nIn choosing to suspend Peyrin, Vice Chancellor Hermalin and the university are clearly choosing to exercise personal bias in an attempt to appease the Trump Administration, in flagrant violation of university policy and the first amendment. Even the EE and CS chairs admit that it is unclear that this action constitutes a violation of any university policy (as per The Daily Cal).\n\nThis is NOT acceptable behavior from a university which champions itself as a bastion of free speech, nor is it an acceptable way to treat a lecturer who consistently goes above and beyond, both for his students and his department."

Peyrin's contributions to CS at Berkeley are nothing short of a miracle for the department, and to be frank, losing Peyrin will be a disaster. The department needs to be made aware.\n\nNever have I ever seen someone as devoted or hardworking as Peyrin. Myself and/or my friends have directly seen him:\n\n- Sleep in Soda Hall after working long into the night\n- With the help of a few TA's, grade an exam literally overnight, by staying up past midnight\n- Answer so many students' Ed questions that he started to post them as invisible-to-students so that other TA's could copy-paste his responses and take the credit\n- Bail out overflowing office hours queues when TA's were swamped--even though he wasn't officially teaching that class that semester\n- Be actively working at 12AM on New Year's Day\n\nPeyrin has the unique ability to run multiple classes smoothly in a way that absolutely no professor or head TA ever could. In every semester I've worked with him, he has been majorly involved in running logistics for at the bare minimum, 3 or 4 different courses, often without even officially being an instructor. No task is too menial or too complex for him--he isn't afraid to go print exams at 3 in the morning, but has the knowledge and experience to write exam questions and deal with far-reaching course policies.\n\nWhile TA's and instructors certainly work hard, Peyrin is an incredible force multiplier and his loss would directly torpedo the effectiveness of, at minimum, 4 different key courses (CS 61B, CS 161, CS 188, CS 168). With less capacity to handle students in these classes, and with students less prepared and more stressed for follow-on courses, the effects will propagate throughout the entire department like a tsunami.\n\nAny insinuation that Peyrin's activism or hunger strike have negatively impacted his teaching abilities and student learning is preposterous, because he's always done so much more than has been expected of him. Even if he was 1/2 as productive as he is, he would still be as effective as a particularly hardworking teaching professor--and leagues beyond many of my professors, to be honest.\n\nI'll leave it to my peers to speak about other factors. But from a pedagogical standpoint, suspending Peyrin would be the biggest mistake the department could make."

STEM studies are too often depoliticized and sanitized, but the truth is that nothing we study and none of the work we do can be free of politics. We need to be having more of the discussions that Peyrin was starting, not less."

I have had the pleasure of organizing with him, and I am inspired by his humility and steadfastness. During his hunger strike, he constantly stated that this action is about the genocide in Palestine - not about him - and he rigorously promoted humanitarian aid efforts for individuals and families in Gaza. Peyrin's humanity has restored my previously lost hope that it is possible to be a person of conscience within the STEM community. This hope is key to my personal and professional identity, as I studied Astrophysics at Cal. In my recent-grad years, I worked as a Planetarium Educator at The Lawrence Hall of Science, where I integrated my politics of liberation into my teaching. The University's shameful attempt to silence Peyrin inspires me to speak louder - this suspension is evidence that our voices are working to bring truth to power."

Peyrin works tirelessly to help his students grow and learn. Peyrin does not brainwash or indoctrinate his students; he encourages them to approach their careers with concern for the broader picture. \n\nThe administration of UC Berkeley has clearly demonstrated their opposition to free speech about the ongoing genocide, ethnic cleansing and war crimes in Palestine, funded and laundered by the US government. We as community members, students, and student staff support Peyrin Kao's immediate reinstatement and we stand ironclad in support of a free Palestine."

When I think about Berkeley, I think about the way that free speech was touted as an important part of the university's legacy. To throw that legacy - and what makes Berkeley so special - away over ongoing support for a genocide is laughable. \n\nThe EECS major at Berkeley required students to complete an ethics course to graduate because despite the purpotedly \"neutral\" nature of engineering and computer science, nothing about engineering is neutral. The products we make have real-world impact. However, it seems like the EECS department has forgotten its own teachings - when faced with an actual moral dilemma, they have failed spectacularly.\n\nI am in full support of Peyrin and believe he should be reinstated."

The AI and computing technologies being used to surveil Palestinians and mark them for death are most certainly built upon Berkeley innovations in computer vision, databases, etc. At the very least, then, now is the time for us computer scientists to recognize the evil our contributions are being used for and to stand against it. It is damning that the administration would choose to punish and silence the member of CS faculty with the greatest moral clarity around this, and I'm deeply ashamed of my alma mater. (And I'm sure when I visit campus in 30 years I'll be able to drop in on the \"Free Palestine\" Cafe, where there'll be a plaque honoring Peyrin's bravery so the administration can reap the reputational rewards of having always been against genocide once it is again politically convenient.)"

My own research and scholarly discipline is predicated on the idea that science, technology, and medicine, are not neutral scientific enterprises. I teach undergrads-- frequently, those in the college of engineering and the new college of CS-- that science is a social process, and that the choices they make as scientists have profound historical, cultural, and ethical dimensions. UCVP Hermalin's letter is not merely an affront to academic freedom of speech. It also serves only to marginalize scholarship that affirms with Prof. Kao shared with his class: that being a scientist does not make you immune from ethical inquiry. My own ability to teach UC Berkeley undergrads is undermined by the insistence from the highest level of the university that there is no appropriate consideration of ethics or politics that can be allowed in the STEM classroom. It makes it actively more difficult to engage with students when University messaging positions STEM as neutral, empirical, and apolitical. Why would we want to send graduates into the world who are encouraged to dodge difficult questions about the impact they want their work to have in the world?"

So any apolitical justification makes 0 sense.\nHowever, a political justification forms this as a first amendment rights violation - if it wasn't impacting his ability to do his job, it wasn't affecting or hurting other people, than he should not be fired."

He is passionate about Palestinian lives, ethics in tech, and being an educator. Not only is he an asset to his department, but he is a great role model for how we can bring activism into our workplaces and communities. UC Berkeley would truly suffer without his presence, which is why this unjust suspension is even more harmful. Shame on the university for attempting to silence Peyrin Kao, who has brought attention to these issues in a way that did *not* interrupt class time or force students to do anything they did not wish to do.\nSomething that Peyrin also emphasizes is keeping Palestinian voices centered, so let’s not forget the main issue here - Palestine is still occupied and surveilled, crucial medical resources are still being blocked by their violent colonizers, and men, women, children, and elders are still needlessly dying. Shame on the university and its complicit leadership, divest from the corporations who are funding the occupation, and free Palestine."

He is the only one who was genuine with condolences and even offered resources Incase the grief was too much to bare throughout the semester. I truly appreciate Peyrin and only have kind words to say. I cannot say the same for many of the other CS lecturers at UCB. The only thing he is guilty of is having courage and empathy. We have the freedom to protest and speech, but why is it no longer a right against a known genocide? These actions against Peyrin aren’t justified and simply wrong. He is a critical asset to the Computer Science department. Not many CS professors at CAL are meant to teach. Peyrin is the exception and should have been protected by this institution."

      "comment": "Peyrin is the best lecturer I’ve had at UC Berkeley in computer science. It has always been his very first priority to make his students feel safe, heard, and understood. Though STEM is inherently political as it shapes human rights, never once did Peyrin even allude to his political views during class time, and never once did the quality of his commitment to his teaching falter even during his hunger strike. His suspension for engaging in a hunger strike as a peaceful act of protest against the genocide of the Palestinian people is a profound betrayal of the values UC Berkeley claims to uphold. STEM is not morally neutral. Cloud services, AI systems, and weapons technology, all fields shaped by universities like ours, play a direct role in the violence Palestinians face. Peyrin is one of the few faculty members who has openly asked us to confront that reality, and his courage is exactly what academic spaces should protect, not punish. ​​As the letter states, there are no universities left in Gaza. Hundreds of thousands of Palestinian students have lost years of education, and it is unconscionable for UC Berkeley to claim it is protecting “the rights of all to teaching and learning” while disciplining a lecturer who demanded an end to the destruction of an entire people’s educational future. I am signing because divestment is the bare minimum, and reinstating Peyrin is an urgent necessity. I am signing because I want a university that stands with those who speak for justice, not one that silences them. I am signing because I want to be proud of this institution, and right now, I cannot be unless it corrects this wrong. As a student, I stand unequivocally with Peyrin and with the people of Palestine. We will not be intimidated into silence."
