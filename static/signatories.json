      "comment": "This is a flagrant violation of free speech and mimics big tech's repression pro-Palestine, the same repression that Peyrin was talking about to begin with. The same tactics that lead to dozens of workers at Google, Amazon, and Microsoft being fired are also being used here because Peyrin dared to speak out for what he believes in.\n\nIt's clear UC Berkeley is specifically coming after pro-Palestine speech. STEM studies are too often depoliticized and sanitized, but the truth is that nothing we study and none of the work we do can be free of politics. We need to be having more of the discussions that Peyrin was starting, not less."

I imagine many Berkeley students arrived here excited to change people's lives for the better through excellent training... and I believe the university (outwardly) encourages that mindset. Why, then, are we expected not to care about the impact of the institution in which we participate?"

Ben Hermalin will be catalogued as a Judas of all that education and humanity stand for. I would highly encourage him to resign, stand up for something or sit down!"
